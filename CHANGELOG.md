# Changelog

## 0.28.1 - 2026-07-15

- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.28.1, inheriting the repaired
  official HTTPS source for CODE ultra-rapid products and the symmetric RTK
  candidate-selection fixes.

## 0.28.0 - 2026-07-13

- Adds per-cell SP3 precedence, optional deterministic outlier rejection,
  clock-outlier report access, and observed/predicted epoch summaries.
- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.28.0.

## 0.27.1 - 2026-07-13

- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.27.1.
- Fixes LAMBDA integer least-squares searches with finite ambiguities outside
  the `int64_t` output domain: they now return
  `SIDEREON_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT` instead of a successful result containing
  saturated integers and non-finite scores.

## 0.27.0 - 2026-07-12

- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.27.0.
- Adds `sidereon_geoid_grid_from_proj_egm96_gtx` for PROJ's public EGM96
  15-arcminute GTX grid.
- Adds `sidereon_geoid_grid_undulation_proj_rad` with an explicit
  fused-versus-separately-rounded arithmetic selector and typed coordinate
  error detail. Existing geoid lookup functions retain their previous bits.

## 0.26.1 - 2026-07-12

- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.26.1.
- Fixes a process/VM denial of service when parsing malicious RINEX 2
  observation input with an oversized declared epoch satellite count. C binding
  releases 0.11.1 through 0.26.0 are affected; upgrade to 0.26.1 or later.

## 0.26.0 - 2026-07-12

- Builds against `sidereon` and `sidereon-core` 0.26.0.
- Removes the unsound sequential RTK innovation-screen interface together with
  `SidereonRtkInnovationScreen`, its epoch accessor, and the three corresponding
  fields in `SidereonRtkArcUpdateOptions`. This is an intentional breaking ABI
  change matching the core 0.26.0 removal.
- Inherits the core fix that keeps near-polar TEC coordinates finite.
